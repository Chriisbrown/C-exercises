Readme for compling the track finder algorithm and associated classes

C++11 is needed for this compilation.

Run make in the desired director with the command make. The ROOT libraries are needed as is a working g++ compiler
Ensure both the onetrack.raw and manytracks.raw are in the desired directory

This will compile to a executable called track_finder.exe

This can be run with ./track_finder.exe - the program has a menu functionality for navigating various options

The python program analysis.py is included and will produce histograms and fits of the data but requires several python packages to run
